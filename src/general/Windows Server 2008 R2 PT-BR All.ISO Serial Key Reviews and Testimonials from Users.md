These languages are provided as language packs that contain the resources and files needed to change the display language of the operating system. Windows desktop editions also support language interface packs (LIPs), which are partial translations that work on top of a base language pack. LIPs are not available for Windows Server. To learn more about how to install and use language packs, see Language packs.
  
Language packs and LIPs are available for download from the Microsoft Store or the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). You can also use Windows Update or the Language Pack ISO files to install language packs. To check which languages are installed on your device, go to Settings > Time & Language > Language.

When you install a language pack or a LIP, you can change the display language of Windows and its features, such as the Start menu, Settings, File Explorer, and apps. You can also change the input language and keyboard layout to type in different languages. To switch between languages, use the language icon on the taskbar or press the Windows logo key + Spacebar.
  
A LIP is a type of language pack that provides a translated version of the most widely used areas of the user interface. LIPs require at least one parent language pack to be installed first. For example, to install the Catalan LIP, you need to have either Spanish or French as the base language. LIPs are useful for users who want to use Windows in a less common language, but they do not cover all the features and apps of Windows.
  
Language packs and LIPs are not only useful for changing the display language of Windows, but also for enabling multilingual support in apps and websites. For example, if you have an app that supports multiple languages, you can use the language packs and LIPs to provide localized content and user interface elements for your users. Similarly, if you have a website that targets a global audience, you can use the language packs and LIPs to display the content in the preferred language of your visitors.

Language packs and LIPs also help you to comply with the accessibility and localization requirements of different regions and markets. For example, some countries or organizations may have specific regulations or standards for the use of languages in software and online services. By installing the appropriate language packs and LIPs, you can ensure that your Windows device meets these requirements and provides a better user experience for your customers and partners.
  
To manage the language settings and preferences on your Windows device, you can use the Language page in Settings or the Control Panel. You can also use PowerShell commands or Group Policy settings to configure the language options for multiple devices in a network. For more information on how to manage language packs and LIPs, see Manage the input and display language settings in Windows 10.

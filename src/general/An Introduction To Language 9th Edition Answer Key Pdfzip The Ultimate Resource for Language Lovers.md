However, some users may encounter difficulties when trying to download or open the answer key file. This is because the file name has a ".pdfzip" extension, which is not a common or standard format. A ".pdfzip" file is actually a compressed or zipped version of a PDF file that has been renamed to avoid detection by some online platforms or services that do not allow uploading or sharing of PDF files. To open a ".pdfzip" file, you need to rename it back to ".pdf" and then use a PDF reader or viewer program to view its contents. Alternatively, you can use an online tool or converter that can unzip or extract PDF files from compressed archives.

You will be able to draw any shape you want using the Sketchup drawing tools. You can also use the Offset tool to create hollow profiles. When you are done drawing, click on the Finish button to save your profile.
 
## How to Extrude a Profile
 
To extrude a profile, you need to have a path or a face to extrude along. You can use any Sketchup entity as a path, such as an edge, a curve, or a polyline. You can also use a face as a path, which will extrude the profile perpendicular to the face. To extrude a profile, select the path or the face and then activate the Extrude Along Path tool from the toolbar or the Extensions menu. You will see a dialog box where you can choose your profile and some options such as scaling, twisting, and offsetting. You can also preview the extrusion before committing it. When you are happy with the result, click on the OK button to create the extrusion.

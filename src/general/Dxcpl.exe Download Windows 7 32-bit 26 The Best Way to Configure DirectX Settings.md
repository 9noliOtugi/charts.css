# How to Use D3DConfig to Manage DirectX Control Panel Settings on Windows 7 32-bit
 
If you are a developer who works with Direct3D, you may be familiar with the DirectX Control Panel (DXCpl.exe), a utility that allows you to configure Direct3D debug settings for your applications. However, DXCpl.exe has some limitations, such as not supporting modern DX12 debugging options, not integrating into automation scripts, and not being compatible with scaled-down Windows platforms that do not support Win32-based user interfaces.
 
Fortunately, there is a new tool that can help you overcome these challenges: D3DConfig.exe. D3DConfig.exe is a console app that can display and modify the DXCpl settings from the command line or batch script. D3DConfig.exe is part of the Graphics Tools Feature-on-Demand and is available in the â20H1â Windows 10 Insider Preview (currently build 18970 in fast-ring). If you already have Graphics Tools installed, then updating to 20H1 will automatically add D3DConfig to your system. If you don't have Graphics Tools installed, you can do so by using Windows 10 âManage Optional Featuresâ settings, or by running the following command:

 `> DISM /online /add-capability /capabilityname:tools.graphics.directx~~~~0.0.1.0` 
You can still use the DirectX Control Panel if you like. D3DConfig recognizes DXCpl settings. Similarly, the DXCpl reflects most D3DConfig settings. However, new settings are likely to be exposed only in the D3DConfig tool. For example, DRED settings are only available in D3DConfig.
 
## Examples of Using D3DConfig
 
Like DXCpl, only registered apps are affected by the D3DConfig settings. To list the currently registered apps, run:
 `> d3dconfig apps
apps
--------------------------------
foo.exe
bar.exe`

 `> d3dconfig apps --add MyBuggyGame.exe
apps
--------------------------------
MyBuggyGame.exe
foo.exe
bar.exe` 
Apps can also be registered using directory scope (yes, the terminating â\\â character is needed):
 `> d3dconfig apps --add g:\\bin\\games\\
apps
--------------------------------
g:\\bin\\games\\
MyBuggyGame.exe
foo.exe
bar.exe` 
One of the most common tasks done in DXCpl is to force the debug layer on. The D3DConfig tool can do that too.
 `> d3dconfig debug-layer debug-layer-mode=force-on
debug-layer
----------------
debug-layer-mode=force-on` 
Break-on debug messages can also be controlled using D3DConfig. In order to remain compatible with the DX Control Panel, this is a two-step process:
 `> d3dconfig message-break allow-debug-breaks=true
message-break
----------------
allow-debug-breaks=true

> d3dconfig message-break --add-id-12 722
message-break
----------------
Break-On D3D11 Message Ids: 
Break-On D3D12 Message Ids: 722: D3D12_MESSAGE_ID_CREATERESOURCE_INVALIDMIPLEVELS` 
## How to Download Dxcpl.exe for Windows 7 32-bit
 
If you are still using Windows 7 32-bit and want to use DXCpl.exe, you may have trouble finding it on your system. That's because DXCpl.exe is not included in the default installation of DirectX on Windows 7. You need to download and install the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Microsoft's website[^2^]. This installer will update your DirectX runtime components and add DXCpl.exe to your system.
 
To download and install the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer, follow these steps:

Iridient X Transformer 1.1 Win is a utility that can convert your RAF files to DNG format using Iridient Digital's high quality RAW processing algorithms[^1^]. DNG is a universal RAW format that is compatible with most software applications, and preserves all the original image data and metadata. By converting your RAF files to DNG, you can take advantage of Iridient Digital's superior RAW processing, sharpening, noise reduction and lens corrections, while still having the flexibility to edit your images in your preferred software.
 
Iridient X Transformer 1.1 Win is easy to use and fast. You can drag and drop your RAF files into the program window, or use the batch processing option to convert multiple files at once. You can also customize the conversion settings, such as output size, compression, color profile, sharpening amount and noise reduction level. You can preview the converted DNG files before saving them, and compare them with the original RAF files.
 
Iridient X Transformer 1.1 Win is compatible with Windows 7 or later, and requires a Fujifilm camera that supports RAF format. You can download a free demo version from Iridient Digital's website[^1^], or purchase a full license for $29.99 USD.

One of the benefits of converting your RAF files to DNG is that you can enjoy the advantages of DNG format. DNG is a universal and open-source format that is supported by most software applications and camera manufacturers[^1^]. It is also future-proof, meaning that you can access your DNG files even if your original RAF files become obsolete or incompatible with new technology.
 
DNG files are also smaller and faster than RAF files. They can be compressed by 15-20% without losing any image quality[^2^] [^3^]. They also store a standard-size preview within the file itself, which allows for quicker loading and editing in Adobe Lightroom or Camera Raw[^1^]. DNG files also have a self-check feature that can detect and correct any corruption in the file[^2^].
 
However, there are also some drawbacks of DNG files that you should be aware of. One is that converting your RAF files to DNG takes time and effort, which may not be convenient for some workflows. Another is that DNG files may strip out some information from your RAF files, such as JPEG previews, GPS data, metadata, and camera-specific settings[^2^]. This means that you may lose some flexibility and control over your images if you want to revert to the original RAF file later.
 
Ultimately, the choice between RAF and DNG depends on your personal preference and needs. Some photographers prefer to keep their original RAF files for archival purposes, while others prefer to convert them to DNG for easier editing and storage. You can also use both formats, by saving your original RAF files in one location and your converted DNG files in another. This way, you can have the best of both worlds.

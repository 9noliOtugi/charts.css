# How to Crack Natural Motion Endorphin 1.1 and Create Stunning Animations
  
Natural Motion Endorphin is a dynamic motion synthesis software package developed by NaturalMotion that can be used to generate computer simulations of large numbers of independent characters interacting with each other and the world according to brief scripts or 'behaviours'.[^4^] [^6^]
  
Endorphin can create realistic animations by combining physics, AI, and genetic algorithms. It has been used in movies and video games such as Troy, Poseidon and Tekken 5.[^4^] However, Endorphin is not an engine, but a 3D animation tool for Microsoft Windows that requires a product key to activate.[^2^]

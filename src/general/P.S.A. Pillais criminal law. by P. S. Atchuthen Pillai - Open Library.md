## History of the Indian Penal Code
 
The Indian Penal Code was drafted by the First Law Commission of India, which was established in 1834 under the Charter Act of 1833. The commission was chaired by Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British historian and politician, who was also a member of the Governor-General's Council. Macaulay and his team prepared a draft based on the principles of English criminal law, but also incorporated elements from other sources, such as the Napoleonic Code and the Louisiana Civil Code of 1825. The draft was submitted to the Governor-General in 1837, but it underwent several revisions and amendments before it was finally passed by the Legislative Council in 1860. The code came into force on January 1, 1862, replacing the various rules and regulations on criminal law that prevailed in different parts of British India [^2^].
 
The Indian Penal Code was one of the first codifications of criminal law in the common law world. It was also one of the most influential codes, as it was adopted by many other countries and regions that were under British rule or influence, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei. The code has also been a source of inspiration for other countries that have developed their own criminal codes, such as Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe[^2^].

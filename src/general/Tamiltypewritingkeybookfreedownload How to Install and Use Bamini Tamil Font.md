If you want to learn how to type Tamil on a computer keyboard, you need to install a Tamil keyboard software on your computer or device. There are many Tamil keyboard software available online, such as Kural Tamil Software, NHM Writer, Azhagi, etc. You can download them from their official websites or from other sources. Once you install the Tamil keyboard software, you can switch between English and Tamil input modes by using a shortcut key or by clicking on the language icon on the taskbar. You can also customize the keyboard layout and settings according to your preference.
 
Typing Tamil on a computer keyboard is different from typing on a typewriter. You do not need to use the shift key to type capital letters or special symbols. You can type Tamil letters by using the corresponding keys on the keyboard. For example, to type à®, you can press A; to type à®, you can press AA; to type à®, you can press I; and so on. To type conjunct consonants or vowel signs, you need to use the backspace key or the spacebar after typing the base letter. For example, to type à®à¯, you can press K and then backspace; to type à®à®¾, you can press K and then AA; to type à®à®¿, you can press K and then I; and so on. To type numerals or punctuation marks, you can use the same keys as in English.
 
Typing Tamil on a computer keyboard may seem difficult at first, but with practice and patience, you can master it easily. You can use online typing tutors or games to improve your typing speed and accuracy. You can also use online dictionaries or translators to check your spelling and grammar. Typing Tamil on a computer keyboard is a useful skill that can help you communicate with others in your native language and access various online resources in Tamil.

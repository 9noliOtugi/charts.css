- Automatic generation of views, sections, elevations and details from 3D models
- Creation of shop drawings and fabrication drawings with accurate dimensions, annotations and symbols
- Integration with Autodesk Revit Structure for bi-directional data exchange and coordination
- Customization of drawing styles, templates and standards to meet specific project requirements
- Support for international codes and standards for steel and concrete design

AutoCAD Structural Detailing 2012 is available in two versions: one for steel structures and one for concrete structures. Each version has specific tools and functionalities for the respective material. Users can also switch between the versions within the same interface.
 
To install AutoCAD Structural Detailing 2012 on a 64-bit operating system, users need to download the ISZ file from the Autodesk website or use a DVD drive. The ISZ file is a compressed image file that can be mounted as a virtual drive using software such as UltraISO or Daemon Tools. The installation process is similar to that of other Autodesk products.
 
AutoCAD Structural Detailing 2012 is a powerful and efficient software that can help users to create high-quality drawings for steel and concrete structures. It is compatible with other Autodesk products and supports industry standards. Users can download a free trial version from the Autodesk website or contact an authorized reseller for more information.

## Detailing Tools
 
AutoCAD Structural Detailing 2012 provides a set of tools for creating detailed drawings of steel and concrete structures. Users can create views, sections, elevations and details from 3D models automatically, or use manual tools to draw reinforcement bars, wire fabrics, bolts, welds and other elements. Users can also customize the drawing styles, templates and standards to meet their specific needs.
 
## Enhanced Detailing Capabilities
 
AutoCAD Structural Detailing 2012 offers enhanced capabilities for detailing steel and concrete structures, such as:

- 3D view of reinforcement of a structure's elements: Users can view the reinforcement of columns, beams, walls and slabs in 3D mode, and modify the properties and parameters of the bars and fabrics.
- 3D Solid used as a structure's elements: Users can use 3D solids as structure elements, and apply reinforcement to them using the same tools as for standard elements.
- Description of bar distribution: Users can define the distribution of bars along a path or a surface using various methods, such as spacing, number of bars, length or area.
- Extended functionality of descriptions and tables for displaying reinforcement shape: Users can display the shape of reinforcement bars and wire fabrics in descriptions and tables using symbols or text. Users can also customize the symbols and text to suit their preferences.
- Extended functionality for reinforcement tables: Users can create tables that show the properties and quantities of reinforcement bars and wire fabrics in a drawing. Users can also edit the table contents and format using various options.
- Additional reinforcement symbols: Users can use additional symbols for reinforcement bars and wire fabrics, such as hooks, bends, stirrups, ties and spacers.
- Extended functionality for surface reinforcement: Users can create surface reinforcement for walls and slabs using wire fabrics or bars. Users can also modify the properties and parameters of the surface reinforcement using various options.
- Extended functionality for surface distributions of wire fabrics: Users can define the distribution of wire fabrics on a surface using various methods, such as spacing, number of meshes, length or area.

## Integration with Autodesk Revit Structure
 
AutoCAD Structural Detailing 2012 integrates with Autodesk Revit Structure software for bi-directional data exchange and coordination. Users can import 3D models from Revit Structure into AutoCAD Structural Detailing, and apply reinforcement to them. Users can also export detailed drawings from AutoCAD Structural Detailing to Revit Structure, and update them when changes occur. This integration helps users to streamline their workflow and improve their productivity.
